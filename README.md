# LSE_DA_COVID_analysis
The assessment of the Gibraltar Covid19 data subset shows data collected over 632 days (as shown by the count). There were 97 deaths over this period of time and the total number of cases were 5727 and 4670 patients recovered. 
The data is cumulative, and the summary statistics derived from the describe function can not be used to properly evaluate the data. For example, the number of deaths is fixed number (97 in total), so it is not appropriate to calculate the mean/std/percentiles unless comparisons were being drawn from the Gibraltar data subset and other regions. The same applies to the number of cases and the number of patients recovered and hospitalisations. 
Further assessment of the data would be required to a deeper insight into Covid19 statistics through comparative analysis based on regions, countries etc and examining any correlations with the vaccination data. For example, it would be good to understand how the number of cases changed over time and along with the vaccination rate and delivery of the first/second doses. Similarly, the impact of vaccination with regards to the death rate would be an interesting topic to explore within the datasets. 
Review of the dosing across different Provinces/States shows that Gibraltar has delivered the highest number of first and second doses. Saint Helen, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha has delivered the lowest number of first and second doses. Differences associated with dose delivery will also be impacted by the size of the population and other logistic/delivery factors. Calculating the per cent of individuals who have received both the first and second dose shows a very similar delivery/success rate as all Provinces/States have achieved >95%. Review of the dataset itself shows that vaccine delivery/dosing increased in numbers from the start of 2021 when the vaccines became available, and looked to peak in Q2.
